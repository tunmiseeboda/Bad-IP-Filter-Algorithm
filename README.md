# Bad-IP-Filter-Algorithm
Created an algorithm that filters corrupt IP addresses using Python regular expressions along with files and exceptions. 
Through file handling, a user-friendly input system, dynamic inputs, and error handling, the algorithm can ensure the existence of the input file and verify the creation of the output file using a try...except block.
